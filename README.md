# Dictionary API test
This project is a test to fetch a dictionary API. I'm planning to make a bigger project in the future using the same API but for a game. To use this repository you need to:

### 1. Open the repositorys website in your browswer
The link is provided further down in this document.

### 2. That's it!
You can now fetch the definition of any word in the API using the input box and the "Go!" button.
